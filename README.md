# Mandelbrot
Mandelbrotset in Go

For usage just type `go run main.go` in the command line of the file. 
You can also change the parameters `-x` and `-y` to change the positon of the center point and `-dx` and `-dy` for the width and height of the displayed part of the Mandelbrot-set. 
Use `-w` and `-h` to set the width and height of the output image and `-i` to set the iterations of the Mandelbrot-set. The higher i is the more accurat the Mandelbrot-set will be.
To change the file the image will be saved in use `-file` and give the filename you want. Notice that the image will be saved in .png and you therefor have to give no ending to the parameter.
